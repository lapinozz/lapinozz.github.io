I am lapinozz, you can call me Charle (that's not my name though, I don't know why you would). I'm a C++ programmer, I love to toy with low level concepts and code. I'm very curious by nature, I constantly read about new ways of solving problems or about what i can do to improve my code, I also keep making various project, sometime quite pointless, on subjects i like, that it is a game in Assembly, a compiler, a code generator using genetic algorithm or rewriting the Facebook messaging API. It's always fun and get's me to learn a lot.
