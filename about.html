 I am lapinozz, you can call me Charle (I don't know why you would though, that's not my name). I'm a C++ programmer by heart and in general enjoy toying around with low level concepts. I love learning new ways to solve problems or coming up with my own hacked way of doing so. In my freetime I like to work on various projects, some with questionable importance. For example: A game written in Assembly-Language, a compiler for my own custom language, a code generator using a self-evolving algorithm, writing a custom API for interacting with Facebook's messasing system. I enjoy these kind of projects, because they are exciting and get me to learn a lot.
