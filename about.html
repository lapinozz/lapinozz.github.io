I am lapinozz, you can call be Charle (that's not my name thought, I dont know why you would). Im a C++ programmer, I love to toy with low level concept and code. Im very curious by nature, constantly i read about new way of solving problems or about what i can do to improve my code, I also keep making various project, sometime quite pointless, on subject i like, that it is an game in Assembly, a compiler, a code generator using genetical algorithm or rewriting the Facebook messaging API it's always fun and get me to learn a lot.
