 I am lapinozz, you can call me Charle (I don't know why you would though, that's not my name). I'm a C++ programmer by heart, enjoy toying around with low level concepts and trying new things. I love learning new ways to solve problems or coming up with my own hacked way of doing so. In my freetime I like to work on various projects, some with questionable importance..
